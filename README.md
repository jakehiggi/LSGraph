This is the software that I wrote for my Master's in Physics, designed to analyse and manipulate data from Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS). 
This is the first larger project that I have undertaken, so it does contain errors and could have been more efficiently assembled. 
I have included a sample set of data that was provided to me at the time of my project, and I have included it only for demonstration purposes.

To start, the data may be dragged and dropped into the Tree Widget on the left of the main window, and from there, individual data sets may be dragged onto graph windows, or added manually from the graph window.
